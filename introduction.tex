\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Talk about graphical believability and how AI in games should accompany this trend
	\item Talk about engagement in games through NPCs (better NPCs create a better game experience).
	\item Talk about the lack of AI for survival games (maybe use Left 4 Dead 2 as an example of an AI)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem}
"Can we improve a player's game-play experience in a survival game using social agents?"

\subsection{Hypothesis}


\subsection{Objectives}
Develop a model that combines the social interaction with players and the capacity of an agent to survive in a survival game
Check if players like to play with the agent
and check if they prefer to play with humans or the agent
