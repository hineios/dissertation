\section{Introduction}

For games, one of the most important aspects is the player's experience.
The game's flow and immersion are key elements to this experience \cite{ijsselsteijn:userexperience}, and this is where \ac{AI} comes into play.

In the last years, in order to improve player's game play experience, the game industry have used \ac{AI} with several different purposes: player experience modelling, procedural content generation, massive-scale game data mining, and \ac{NPC} \ac{AI} \cite{yannakakis:gameairevisited}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Talk about graphical believability and how AI in games should accompany this trend
	\item Talk about engagement in games through NPCs (better NPCs create a better game experience).
	\item Talk about the lack of AI for survival games (maybe use Left 4 Dead 2 as an example of an AI)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem}
"Can we improve a player's gameplay experience in Don't Starve Together using social agents?"

\subsection{Hypothesis}


\subsection{Objectives}
Develop a model that combines the social interaction with players and the capacity of an agent to survive in a survival game
Check if players like to play with the agent
and check if they prefer to play with humans or the agent
