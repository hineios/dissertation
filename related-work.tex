\section{Related Work}
Explain how there are two components for the agent, the social component and the survival component.
They may influence each other? Are they really separated?

\subsection{Background}
Talk about Game AI and the most common used techniques in the field (Behaviour Trees, etc) and why are they used.
It will help limit the approach we'll use since we can rule out models that are to time consuming (for example) as we need a real time approach

\subsection{State of the Art}
Rule out models/techniques that do not conform to our requirements (to slow, to "heavy", not adequate for our problem)

\subsection{Related Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Social Agents: what are they? How are they defined? how are they doing it? What about in games?
	\item Communication: what level of communication is needed to achieve a social agent? (should I approach this in it's own section? or should it be integrated in the previous one?)
	\item Playing: how do we make the agent a good player? it should be clear that we need a good playing agent based on the Social Agent part (a bad playing agent will get boring and players will lose interest in it)
\end{itemize}
