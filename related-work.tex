\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}
Over the next sections I'll present the ground work for the agent I want to achieve.
Using what we've seen in \ref{sec:social-agents}, what an agent is and what it needs to have/do in order to be considered social, I'll analyse several different architectures and models that implement social agents.
%Afterwards I'll present some works related to collaborative agents since it may help in the specification of my model.
I'll then conclude with a Discussion section where I'll sum up all the pros and cons of the presented works, by this point it should be clear what I'm going to use in my model and why I'm using it.

\subsection{Discussion}
Throughout the previous sections we've looked at social agents and some works that use and implement social agents.
%We've also taken a look at collaborative agents with the purpose of defining a model to implement a social agent.
There are several aspects that an agent must possess in order to be considered social, as discussed in \ref{sec:social-agents}.
Keeping in mind that the agent's actions must be social by design, the key capability of a social agent is mind-reading.

All of the explored architectures have mind-reading capabilities provided by the use of \ac{TOM} models.
\ac{TOM} models allow the agent to include other agents perceived intentions and desires in its deliberative process (either in choosing a single action or in its planning processes).
Versu's \ac{TOM} model is based on exclusion logic.
Although powerful, this representation encompasses limitations on what we can express as we saw in \ref{sec:versu}.
On another hand, PsychSim's agents are empowered with fully specified models of each other.
However, these mental models are predefined, an ill-suited option for the agent since it will be dealing with unknown human players.
Dorgoly's architecture, however, presents a much more versatile approach in which every event will continuously construct the models of other agents.

One of the main points argued was the planning capabilities of the architectures/models.
Planning is paramount for the agent as it may imply the agent's survival \footnote{As we've previously seen in \ref{sec:dst} the agent must be able to prepare himself, for example, to last through Winter scarcity of resources. }.
As we've seen, PsychSim, \ac{CiF}, and Versu lack this ability while \ac{FAtiMA} and Dorgoly's architecture don't.
However, Dorgoly's architecture use of roles (social context) in influencing planning, provides a straightforward medium make the agent's actions social.

Although it was not a requirement, both \ac{FAtiMA} and Dorgoly's architecture made use of appraisal theories to model emotions.
This is also significant for this work's purpose.
Expressing emotions is one key aspect of believability \cite{bates:believable-agents}, which can help players in engaging with the agent.
The use of a believable agent will help in improving the game play experience of the players, our main objective.

Finally, Dorgoly's architecture distinguishes itself by its use of roles to model social context.
Through the use of roles we can influence the character's reactions and behaviour (e.g. when in the presence of a friendly player, the agent may pro-actively ask for help), making the agent social by nature.

To summarize, these works have all contributed to the design of the proposed solution in the next section.
Their use of \ac{TOM} models, memory, and emotions will all be encompassed in the solution.
However, one work stands out has the most influencing one, Dorgoly's dissertation: An Architecture for Believable Socially Aware Agents.
The proposed solution is heavily based upon Dorgoly's  work, being in fact, an adaptation of it.
