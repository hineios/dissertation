\noindent Today's video games are striving to maintain high levels of fidelity.
The realistic graphical representation of virtual worlds is only betrayed by the lack of believability that in-game characters present.
To maintain the immersion created by exquisite graphics, characters must be able to create the illusion of life, which requires them to possess basic human traits like social ability, reactivity, and active goal pursuit.
Some game genres, like role playing games, have seen this problem being addressed by using agency based characters.
However, survival games have not been subject to the same attention.
In this work, we address this issue by proposing a framework that allows developers to create characters based on agency models for survival games.
By making use of FAtiMA Toolkit, a fully fledged model for agency, and Don't Starve Together, a popular survival game, we've implemented and published such a framework with an example character, Walter.
Walter has been run and tested against a behaviour tree based character.
