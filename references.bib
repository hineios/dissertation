  abstract = {In this paper, we describe the challenge of adequately
characterizing and measuring experiences associated with playing
digital games. We discuss the applicability of traditional usability
metrics to user-centred game design, and highlight two prominent
concepts, flow and immersion, as potential candidates for
evaluating gameplay. The paper concludes by describing the
multi-measure approach taken by the Game Experience Research
Lab in Eindhoven.},
