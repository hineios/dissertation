\begin{abstract}
As an entertainment medium, video games are often used as a way to enter a new reality.
For players, belonging to the world of the game is one of the most important features games can provide.
To deliver this experience, video games companies have, throughout the years, struggled to deliver ever more realistic and life-like games.
The technological advances in computer graphics have brought a level of never seen realism to games and in-game characters must follow this trend in order to keep improving the players' experience.
In this work, I address this problem by proposing and implementing a social architecture for an agent capable of playing \ac{DST}.
I'll analyse several social agents' architectures and implementations.
To evaluate the agent, I'll make it available to the online community of \ac{DST} with a questionnaire to measure the player's experience.
